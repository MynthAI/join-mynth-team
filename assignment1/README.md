# Assignment Overview

**Objective:** Create two microservices that send messages between each
other.

**Purpose:** This task is designed to assess your ability to build
decoupled, scalable, and efficient microservices. By implementing
communication between two independent services, you will demonstrate
your understanding of microservices architecture, distributed systems,
and asynchronous messaging patterns.

## Task Requirements

1.  **Research Phase:**
    - Understand the principles of microservices architecture and how it
      facilitates scalability and maintainability.
    - Research different communication patterns for microservices,
      including synchronous and asynchronous messaging approaches.
    - Learn about different methods of deploying and managing
      microservices.
2.  **Development Phase:**
    - Implement two microservices that can exchange messages while
      remaining independent of each other.
    - Use an asynchronous messaging system to ensure services
      communicate without direct dependencies.
    - Develop APIs for both services to expose their functionality.
    - Ensure both services can run independently and communicate without
      hard dependencies.
3.  **Testing and Documentation:**
    - Write unit and integration tests to validate that the
      microservices communicate correctly and handle messages as
      expected.
    - Document your implementation, detailing the architecture, design
      decisions, and communication mechanism used.
    - Provide a `README.md` with setup instructions, including how to
      deploy, test, and run the microservices.

## Deliverables

A GitHub repository containing:

- Source code for both microservices.
- Configuration files for the chosen messaging infrastructure (if
  applicable).
- Unit and integration tests.
- A `README.md` file with:
  - An overview of the microservices and their communication method.
  - Instructions for setting up the development environment, running the
    services, and executing tests.
  - A summary of challenges faced and how they were addressed.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Architecture and Design:** The effectiveness of your microservices
  architecture and its adherence to best practices.
- **Decoupling and Scalability:** The extent to which the services
  remain independent and scalable.
- **Code Quality:** Readability, maintainability, and adherence to
  software engineering best practices.
- **Testing:** The thoroughness and effectiveness of unit and
  integration tests.
- **Documentation and Communication:** The clarity and completeness of
  the provided documentation.

## Note to Candidates

This assignment is an opportunity to showcase your expertise in
microservices architecture and distributed systems. We encourage you to
think critically about communication patterns and scalability while
implementing a robust and efficient solution. Show us how you design and
build real-world backend systems. Good luck!
