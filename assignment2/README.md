# Assignment Overview

**Objective:** Enhance the readability and maintainability of an
existing TypeScript module.

**Purpose:** This task is designed to test your abilities in refactoring
and optimizing TypeScript code. Your work will demonstrate your
proficiency in TypeScript, your understanding of software design
principles, and your ability to improve the structure of existing code.

## Task Requirements

1.  **Research Phase:**
    - Review the provided TypeScript module to understand its current
      functionality and structure.
    - Identify areas where the code can be improved in terms of
      readability, maintainability, and performance.
    - Learn about best practices in TypeScript development, focusing on
      clean code principles and advanced TypeScript features that could
      be beneficial for the module.
2.  **Refactoring Phase:**
    - Enhance the structure of the TypeScript module by applying
      refactoring techniques that improve readability and
      maintainability.
    - Ensure that the refactoring does not introduce any new bugs or
      change the module’s intended functionality.
3.  **Testing and Documentation:**
    - Create unit tests to cover the refactored code, ensuring all
      functionalities are correctly preserved and behave as expected.
    - Document the changes made, why they were made, and any challenges
      encountered during the refactoring process.
    - Include a guide on how to set up the development environment and
      run the tests for future developers.

## Deliverables

A GitHub repository containing:

- The refactored TypeScript module.
- Unit tests covering the module.
- A `README` file with: - An overview of the original module’s
  functionality.
- A detailed description of the refactoring changes made and the reasons
  behind them.
- Instructions for setting up the development environment, running the
  module, and executing the tests.
- A summary of your experience during the refactoring process, including
  any resources that were particularly useful.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Code Quality:** The refactored code should be cleaner, more
  efficient, and easier to maintain than the original. Attention will be
  paid to how well modern TypeScript features and design patterns are
  utilized.
- **Testing:** The effectiveness of the unit tests in covering both old
  and new functionality.
- **Documentation and Communication:** The clarity and completeness of
  the documentation, including the ease of understanding the setup
  instructions and the rationale behind the refactoring decisions.

## Note to Candidates

This assignment is a great opportunity to showcase your technical skills
and your approach to improving existing software. We are looking for
detailed attention to code quality, thoughtful implementation of
improvements, and thorough documentation. We encourage you to be
creative and critical in how you approach this task. Good luck!
